# FOSI

FOSI is a library for improving first order optimizers with second order information.
Given a first-order base optimizer, 
FOSI works by iteratively splitting the function to minimize into pairs of quadratic problems on orthogonal subspaces,
then using Newton's method to optimize one and the base optimizer to optimize the other.

Our analysis of FOSIâ€™s preconditioner and effective Hessian proves that FOSI improves the condition number for a large family of optimizers.
Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that FOSI improves the convergence rate and optimization time of GD, Heavy-Ball, and Adam when applied to several deep neural networks training tasks such as audio classification, transfer learning, and object classification and when applied to convex functions.

For more information, see our paper, [FOSI: Hybrid First and Second Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08484.pdf).

## Installation

FOSI is written in pure Python.
We support installing `fosi` package on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 or later) and the installation requires Python >=3.8.

### CUDA toolkit

To run FOSI with GPU, CUDA toolkit must be installed.
If using conda environment, the installation command is:
```bash
conda install -c "nvidia/label/cuda-11.8.0" cuda
```
Otherwise, a global installation is required:
```bash
sudo apt-get install cuda
```
After installing CUDA toolkit, follow [NVIDIA's environment setup instructions](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#environment-setup)
to set the environment variables PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
To find the lib/bin folders in case of conda environment use `find ~ -name 'libcusolver.so.11'` and in case of a
global installation with apt-get `find /usr/ -name 'libcusolver.so.11'` and use the containing folder.

Note: CUDA toolkit installation is not required when using the Docker container to run the experiments, or if running on the CPU.


### FOSI package

Use the following instructions to install a
binary package with `pip`, or to download FOSI's source code.

To download FOSI's source code run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hsivan/fosi
```
Let `fosi_root` be the root folder of the project on your local computer, for example `/home/username/fosi`.

To install FOSI run:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/hsivan/fosi.git -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```
Or, download the code and then run:
```bash
pip install <fosi_root> -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

## Basic usage of FOSI

The following example shows how to apply FOSI with the base optimizer Adam.
FOSI is implemented in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and supports [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax)
optimizers as base optimizers.
FOSI's API is also similar to that of Optax optimizers.


```python
import os
# Note: To maintain the default precision as 32-bit and not switch to 64-bit, set the following flag prior to any
# imports of JAX. This is necessary as the jax_enable_x64 flag is later set to True inside the Lanczos algorithm.
os.environ['JAX_DEFAULT_DTYPE_BITS'] = '32'
from fosi import fosi_adam
import jax.numpy as jnp
import jax
import optax

def network(params, x):
    return jnp.dot(x, params)

def loss_fn(params, batch):
    x, y = batch
    y_pred = network(params, x)
    loss = jnp.mean(optax.l2_loss(y_pred, y))
    return loss

def data_generator(key, target_params, n_dim):
    while True:
        key, subkey = jax.random.split(key)
        batch_xs = jax.random.normal(subkey, (16, n_dim))
        batch_ys = jnp.sum(batch_xs * target_params, axis=-1)
        yield batch_xs, batch_ys

# Generate random data
n_dim = 100
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
target_params = 0.5
data_gen = data_generator(key, target_params, n_dim)

# Construct the FOSI-Adam optimizer. The usage after construction is identical to that of Optax optimizers,
# with the optimizer.init() and optimizer.update() methods.
optimizer = fosi_adam(optax.adam(1e-3), loss_fn, next(data_gen))

# Initialize parameters of the model and optimizer
params = jnp.zeros(n_dim)
opt_state = optimizer.init(params)

# A simple update loop.
for i in range(5000):
  loss, grads = jax.value_and_grad(loss_fn)(params, next(data_gen))
  updates, opt_state = jax.jit(optimizer.update)(grads, opt_state, params)
  params = optax.apply_updates(params, updates)
  if i % 100 == 0:
    print("loss:", loss)

assert jnp.allclose(params, target_params), 'Optimization should retrieve the target params used to generate the data.'
```
